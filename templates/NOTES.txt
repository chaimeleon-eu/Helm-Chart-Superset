Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.
Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

{{- if eq .Values.platform "chaimeleon" }}
When the application is ready it will be accesible via Guacamole in the following URL: 
  {{ include "chaimeleon.guacamole-url" . }}

There should be a connection created for that desktop with the following name: 
  {{ include "superset.connectionName" . }}
It can take few seconds to appear (refresh the page if you do not see it).

## Notes for Superset

There is a shortcut in the desktop for opening the Superset web interface in the browser.  
The credentials for accessing are (username/password): admin/admin

Once in the Superset dashboard you can go to "Data" -> "Databases" and create a new database.
Now go to the bottom section "choose from a list" and select "trino" in "SUPPORTED DATABASES".
Now in the field "SQLALCHEMY URI" you should write:  
`trino://trino@trino:8080/chaimeleon`

## Notes for the desktop environment

To show/hide the Guacamole menu: CTRL+SHIFT+ALT

In the file explorer, there will be three important directories:
 - {{ include "chaimeleon.datasets.mount_point" . }}
   [All the datasets you selected to work with]

 - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_home.mount_point" . }}
   [Private persistent storage: for your algoritms, results and whatever you need for the work]

 - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_shared_folder.mount_point" . }}
    [Public storage where you can share files with the other CHAIMELEON users]
